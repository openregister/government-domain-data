Hi,_x000D_
_x000D_
I have taken a look at the two domains listed in your email below._x000D_
_x000D_
allbrookandnorthboyatt-pc.gov.uk – this domain has a fully functional web site. The only discrepancy I could see was that the site didn’t respond to non- www request. We have added a non- www record and the site now resolves to both. Was this the issue that you were reporting and is it a requirement that all .gov.uk sites respond to both www and non- www requests?_x000D_
_x000D_
churchwithchapelbrampton-pc.gov.uk – do not have, nor have I ever known them to have, a web site. CwCB do however use email utilising the CwCB domain name. I also know that ja.net permit .gov.uk domain name for use with emails only. Is it now a requirement that the Parish Council maintain a web site?_x000D_
_x000D_
It might help if somebody gave me a call to discuss. I have tried calling your offices but there was nobody available._x000D_

Hi Marcin,_x000D_
 _x000D_
Please can you put a note on all those domains so that we know what they are used for in the future and do not take breach action against them. Please can you respond to along the following lines:_x000D_
 _x000D_
Hi Richard,_x000D_
 _x000D_
You can be content that these domains will continue to be serviced._x000D_
 _x000D_
As per our previous email (sent via Jisc), you will be aware of the reasons we are carrying out the work to deal with breaches of our domain, gov.uk. With thousands of gov.uk domains to manage, it may not be obvious what each domain is used for or if they are still being used at all, so this is the reason we write to domain owners offering them an opportunity and enough time to respond. Where the suspension of gse.gov.uk is concerned, whilst I appreciate that it may have been embarrassing for you, the NAC need to ensure that we maintain trust for the users of the Cabinet Office domain and where a domain owner does not respond to our questions or requests, suspension or closure, although a last resort, needs to be taken. So to help us, please can you ensure that contact details (on a WHOIS) are always up to date._x000D_

Dear JISC Colleagues_x000D_
 _x000D_
We've received notification from you of domain closure for the following domains:_x000D_
 _x000D_
gcsx.gov.uk_x000D_
_x000D_
gsi.gov.uk_x000D_
_x000D_
   gsx.gov.uk_x000D_
 _x000D_
If you were to close these domains, all of the public sector would cease to be able to use the GSi to communicate securely._x000D_
Please therefore confirm that you are content that these domains will continue to be serviced - and not closed as per your notification._x000D_
It was a little embarrassing that you closed the GSE domain last week - I know you rectified that quickly, but that would be as nothing if compared to the closure of the GSi domain!_x000D_
If you need any further information, please let me know._x000D_
Thanks in advance._x000D_

Hi Marcin,_x000D_
 _x000D_
Please can you put a note on all those domains so that we know what they are used for in the future and do not take breach action against them. Please can you respond to along the following lines:_x000D_
 _x000D_
Hi Richard,_x000D_
 _x000D_
You can be content that these domains will continue to be serviced._x000D_
 _x000D_
As per our previous email (sent via Jisc), you will be aware of the reasons we are carrying out the work to deal with breaches of our domain, gov.uk. With thousands of gov.uk domains to manage, it may not be obvious what each domain is used for or if they are still being used at all, so this is the reason we write to domain owners offering them an opportunity and enough time to respond. Where the suspension of gse.gov.uk is concerned, whilst I appreciate that it may have been embarrassing for you, the NAC need to ensure that we maintain trust for the users of the Cabinet Office domain and where a domain owner does not respond to our questions or requests, suspension or closure, although a last resort, needs to be taken. So to help us, please can you ensure that contact details (on a WHOIS) are always up to date._x000D_

Dear JISC Colleagues_x000D_
 _x000D_
We've received notification from you of domain closure for the following domains:_x000D_
 _x000D_
gcsx.gov.uk_x000D_
_x000D_
gsi.gov.uk_x000D_
_x000D_
   gsx.gov.uk_x000D_
 _x000D_
If you were to close these domains, all of the public sector would cease to be able to use the GSi to communicate securely._x000D_
Please therefore confirm that you are content that these domains will continue to be serviced - and not closed as per your notification._x000D_
It was a little embarrassing that you closed the GSE domain last week - I know you rectified that quickly, but that would be as nothing if compared to the closure of the GSi domain!_x000D_
If you need any further information, please let me know._x000D_
Thanks in advance._x000D_

The domain “moray-edunet.gov.uk” is used by our Educational Services department for email within the curricular environment.  There is no requirement for a website hence no such website has been setup.  This arrangement has been in existence since the domain was first registered in 2003._x000D_
_x000D_
Section 3.2 of the Naming Guidance document is open to some interpretation.  It does not appear to state explicitly that a website must exist for a given domain, only that any such website must comply with the legislation and standards._x000D_
_x000D_
In terms of the other conditions of use set out in the Naming Guidance document, we comply as follows:_x000D_
• We are eligible per the criteria stated in 3.1, namely we are a local government body;_x000D_
• The application using the domain – email – complies with current UK legislation._x000D_

I welcome clarification from you on where there is an explicitly stated requirement for a website to be associated with a given domain._x000D_

We have recently renewed some .nhs.uk domains for them, too._x000D_
_x000D_
I can confirm that NHS Business Services Authority Ltd owns the NHS Pensions Agency. It was absorbed probably about seven years ago? I would get them to update their records, if I was you._x000D_

_x000D_
Evans,_x000D_
_x000D_
You’ll notice the Ltd at the end there. We have some Limited liability companies that are wholly owned by the Secretary of State, so for our purposes, we treat them like a public body as it isn’t really a commercial entity._x000D_

This address/server is used to host a number of our online applications which are developed by our IT partner Equiniti Paymaster. They are separately hosted from our main website’s content management system with is managed by another party. _x000D_

Our expectation is that these applications will eventually find a new home and this address will be decommissioned. That isn’t a current business priority but is scheduled to be picked up as part of our digitisation programme over the next year or so._x000D_

Hi Marcin,_x000D_

Thanks for confirming._x000D_
_x000D_
With regards to opg.gov.uk, our client does require the domain name. The client has been advised of the lack of requirement for protective registrations in the .gov.uk name space, however in the specific case of HMRC, it's important they keep the domains registered as there are DNS configurations in place against email spoofing and fraud._x000D_

Hi Paul,_x000D_
_x000D_
ppo.gov.uk  has an exemption to have its own site off of GOV.UK, which it already does if you click on that URL. So this means that the URL can be used for both website and email purposes. Your IT bods will need to make the relevant changes to that domain to make that technically possible. However the paroleboard.gov.uk URL does not have an exemption from GOV.UK, and therefore sits here for its website. Again in this case, you will be able to use it for email only and your techy guys will need to make the physical changes to put that in place. Please be warned though, if paroleboard.gov.uk is ever used to build its own unique website, I will have to withdraw it altogether as it does not have permission to do so._x000D_

Having spoken with my Scottish NAC representative William Paul, I understand that SEPA are top of the pile with gaining a sepa.gov.scot domain (or whichever domain name you choose to have) as soon as it becomes available. This is a good solution and so I see no reason to put any unnecessary effort or cost into correcting the current breach of sepa.gov.uk. Therefore I have already informed JANET (the gov.uk Naming administrator) to cancel the deletion on sepa.gov.uk and have no intention of taking this matter any further."

I was unaware that it was a requirement for this domain to point to the web page. The domain is only used for mail._x000D_

Hi Richard,_x000D_
_x000D_
Upon speaking with Ben Chapman, I have been advised the details that we originally have provided are insufficient._x000D_
_x000D_
I have contacted the customer and they have given the following:_x000D_
_x000D_
This domain is used to support two Ministry of Justice production systems in Youth Justice:_x000D_
1. The YJB Portal which manages the transfer of young offenders with risk information ensuring their safety._x000D_
2. YJB Connectivity which provides the mechanism for data exchange between Youth Offender Teams, Young Offender Institutions and the Youth Justice Board managing safety, young offender placements and policy_x000D_
In consequence of this incident both systems have been completely out of operation (severity 1 impacts) for over 24 hours and counting. It is URGENT that service is restored._x000D_
Please let me know if this is sufficient._x000D_
_x000D_
Kindest Regards_x000D_
