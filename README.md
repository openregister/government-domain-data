[Rapid7's](lists/rapid7) [Rapid7 Project Sonar
(deprecated)](https://scans.io/study/sonar.fdns), via
[blog](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2015/11/a-complete-list-of-every-uk-government-domain-name/).
[New](https://scans.io/study/sonar.rdns_v2) data is available.

The Sonar Project by Rapid7 gathers, among other things, 'the reverse DNS
records for all IPv4 addresses'.  That is effectively a list of domain names on
the internet, which can be filtered for ones ending '.gov.uk'.  A blogger [did
so](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2015/11/a-complete-list-of-every-uk-government-domain-name/)
in November 2015 and made the method and results available.
